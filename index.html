                      <pre id="R5">REASON: First it will give undefined as output because the girl function is called before the console Statement. The girl function outputs undefined because of
                                   i.  global scope : even though the x is declared at the top, it has global scope, which means it can be accessed anywhere except inside the function but we are having the console

        <pre id="R8">REASON:
            The DisplayData function is passed with 2 parameters, the first parameter is "PrepBytes", so in the function ${data}= PrepBytes and 
            Then the second parameter is FindSum(10,9) which means calling the function FindSum(a,b) so it has to return 10+9=19, hence ${batch} = 19,
            so if we replace this 2 parameters in the console statement we get the final output.
